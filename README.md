To try stuff that could work for Quality Assurance team.

To use the Google Test framework, you need to have CMake installed. The setup script setup.sh will check if CMake is installed, and install it if it isn't, before installing Google Test and compiling the library binaries. (NB setup.sh is intended for Mac OS X users)

## Repo Structure
To avoid any conflicts, all contributors are advised to create project/experiment folders. If you desire a "private" experimental space, name the folder using your name, e.g. `martin_google_framework`.
