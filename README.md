![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hyp-ed/QA-prototype.svg?branch=master)

To try stuff that could work for Quality Assurance team.

The repo does not need to adhere to any coding standard and can be a mix of styles/structures/languages/documents.

## Repo Structure
To avoid any conflicts, all contributors are advised to create project/experiment folders. If you desire a "private" experimental space, name the folder using your name, e.g. `martin_google_framework`.
